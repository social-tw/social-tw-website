# Privacy Disclosure
// TODO: add more description and let user know
We modified Unirep contract to store hashed twitter user ID (handle) in Social TW project. Given any twitter user ID and known hash function, other people are able to know if a certain person has signed up for the Unirep system. However, they are not able to know one's interaction within Social TW.
