# Opening an Issue
When initiating an issue, select a starting template: either Bug Report or Feature Improvement. If you're reporting a bug, ensure that you can demonstrate the bug through testing or a proof of concept. For suggesting a feature enhancement, name it with a clear problem description and verify that a similar request isn't already underway or completed. Be aware that not every issue might be considered necessary to fix, so be prepared to engage in discussions, answering any queries or comments others might have about the issue.
