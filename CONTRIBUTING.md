# Welcome to Unirep Social TW contributing guideline üëãüèª
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! 
This guide will give you an overview of the contribution workflow, from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## How do we start the development? 
  1. Create the branch under social-tw, and name it with the convention of "purpose-scope-unit" (E.g. feat-login-backend)
     [Reference to more prefix of the branch](https://wadehuanglearning.blogspot.com/2019/05/commit-commit-commit-why-what-commit.html)
  2. Create a pull request and name it with the status and the same name as the branch. E.g. [WIP] feat-post-smart-contract
  3. Once the development is done, you can ask for a review. The PR can be merged after approval by **at least one other team member**. 

## Steps for creating good issues.
  1. When encountering an issue while developing, ensure the branch is pushed. (so that people can see what exactly you're working on)
  2. Create an issue and mention the issue in the corresponding pull request. 
  3. Assign the person who can solve the issue with you. (If you don't know who to assign to, go to our discord and share the issue)
